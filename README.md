Project Title: AI-Based Live Object Detection System

Project Summary:
This project aims to develop a real-time object detection system using artificial intelligence and computer vision. The system can identify and locate multiple objects in live video streams or camera feeds, providing bounding boxes and class labels for each detected object. By utilizing deep learning models such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector), or Faster R-CNN, the system achieves fast and accurate detection suitable for dynamic environments.

Key Features:

Real-time detection of multiple objects

Identification and classification of objects into predefined categories

Integration with live camera feeds or video streams

Optional tracking of objects across frames

Technologies Used:

Python, OpenCV for video handling

TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning models

Pre-trained models like YOLOv8 or MobileNet-SSD for efficiency

Numpy and other data-processing libraries

Applications:

Surveillance and security systems

Autonomous vehicles and robotics

Smart retail for product tracking

Industrial automation and monitoring

Future Enhancements:

Adding object tracking to follow moving objects

Optimizing for edge devices like Raspberry Pi for low-latency applications

Combining with alert systems for anomaly detection
